# Fast-Mri-Challenge
The goal was to leverage CNNs to solve the problem of high cost and long scan times associated with MRI, specifically by accurately reconstructing images from subsampled data.
* What I did
To enhance the model, I first studied relevant CNN coursework, performed hyperparameter tuning, and implemented CutMix data augmentation, a technique learned from the '10-10 Project'.

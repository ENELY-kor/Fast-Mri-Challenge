# Fast-Mri-Challenge
The goal was to leverage CNNs to solve the problem of high cost and long scan times associated with MRI, specifically by accurately reconstructing images from subsampled data.
# Overview
Development of a CNN-based image reconstruction model to achieve the goal of the FastMRI Challenge (reducing MRI scan time). Focused on enhancing model robustness and generalization by incorporating the CutMix data augmentation technique.

**Key Tech Stack:** Python, CNN, CutMix, fastMRI Dataset.
